# Automated-EV-Charging
## Overview
This project was created for the Eurobot 2025 contest and it is an implementation of the Astar pathfinding algorithm. In the context of the contest it was used to help the robot navigate the playable area when it encountered
the enemy player and the process of the simple pathfinding failed. Due to it being slower than we wanted, about 500ms -> 1.5s to find optimal path, it couldn't be the main pathfinding tool, but we hope to improve it in the future. <br>

## Getting started
This implementation has some advantages that give it diversabillity and flexibility.
### 1. Step mechanism
This feature is really unique because it enables to
